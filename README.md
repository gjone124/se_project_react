**Intro**

This application is designed to retrieve the current weather at a designated location from an API (openweathermap.org).
Based on the current temperature, clothing is recommended to wear.

This is the 6th project for the Triple Ten Software Engineering program.
It's associated with Sprint 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

Sprint 10 and 11 focuses on building the front end application (se_project_react).

Sprint 12 and 13 focuses on building the back end application (se_project_express).

Sprint 14 and 15 connects the front end and back end applications to each other.

**Procedures To Run Program**

Stage 1 (Sprint 10)

1)open folder titled "se_project_react" in Visual Studio Code

2)to make sure necessary packages are installed for "se_project_react", run in the terminal "npm install" & press "Enter"

3)run "npm run dev" in the terminal for "se_project_react" & press "Enter"

4)the program should automatically run on your designated default browser at "localhost:3000"<br><br><br>

Stage 2 (Sprint 11)

Terminal Scripts Needed To Run Stage 2 (Sprint 11) Program:

1)"npm run dev" (in 1st terminal; split terminal to create 2nd terminal)

2)"json-server --watch db.json --id \_id --port 3001" (in 2nd terminal)<br><br><br>

Stage 5 (Sprint 14) (see se_project_express for Stage 3 & 4)

1)create a folder titled "se_project_wtwr" & store the "se_project_react" folder and "se_project_express" folder inside it

2)open folder titled "se_project_wtwr" in Visual Studio Code

3)open the terminal (the directory should route to your "se_project_wtwr" folder by default)

4)in the terminal, change directories to the express project by typing "cd se_project_express" & press "Enter"

5)the terminal should now be routed to the express project (the back end application)

6)to run "se_project_express", type "npm run dev" in the terminal & press "Enter"

7)create a 2nd terminal by splitting the terminal

8)in the 2nd terminal, change directories to the react project by typing "cd ../se_project_react" & press "Enter"

9)the terminal should now be routed to the react project (the front end application)

10)to run "se_project_react", type "npm run dev" in the terminal & press "Enter"

11)the program should automatically run on your designated default browser at "localhost:3000"<br><br><br>

**Stage 1 (Sprint 10)**

For the 1st stage of the project in Sprint 10 (Introduction to React.js), we were given an adaptive web design through
figma.com ( [link to Stage 1 (Sprint 10) Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/F03bTb81Pw8IDPj5Y9rc5i/Sprint-10-%7C-WTWR) )
and we were told to replicate the web page from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JSX.

The first stage (Sprint 10) involves:

1)calling weather information from the OpenWeather API

2)displaying the weather information on the webpage

3)displaying a default set of clothes depending on if the weather is:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)hot (over 86&deg;F)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)warm (between 66 and 86&deg;F) or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)cold (below 66&deg;F)

4)creating a pop-up window for each piece of clothing that allows the image to expand (and which also displays what
type of weather the clothing is suitable for) when the user clicks on the piece of clothing

5)creating a pop-up window with a submission form when the user clicks on the "Add clothes" button

6)creating a dynamic weather card from 14 possible weather conditions that displays an image that represents the current
weather (optional)

7)creating a mobile version of the webpage so the words and images are not as smooshed together (optional)

**Stage 2 (Sprint 11)**

For the 2nd stage of the project in Sprint 11 (React Routing and State Management), we were given a 2nd design
(which added onto the previous design) through figma.com
( [link to Stage 2 (Sprint 11) Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/dQLJwEKasIdspciJAJrCaf/Sprint-11_-WTWR) ) and we were told
to replicate it.

The second stage (Sprint 11) involves:

1)adding functionality to add & remove pieces of clothing from the collection displayed

2)creating a Toggle Switch to be able to change the temperature displayed from Fahrenheit to Celsius and from
Celsius to Fahrenheit

3)creating a mock server using JSON on your local server (http://localhost:3001)

4)creating a Profile component that displays all the potential clothing options

5)creating 2 routes:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)1 for the Main component ("/"; accessed by clicking in the top left corner on
the "WTWR" logo)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)1 for the Profile component ("/Profile"; accessed by clicking in the tope right
corner on the username (Terrence Tegegne) or the user logo)

6)creating a mobile version of the Profile component (optional)

7)modifying cards to take up full screen width & modifying card rows to shrink / grow smoothly (optional)

**Stage 5 (Sprint 14)**

For the 5th stage of the project in Sprint 14 (Front-End Authentication), we were given a 3rd design
(which added onto the previous design from Sprint 11) through figma.com
( [link to Stage 5 (Sprint 14) Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/bfVOvqlLmoKZ5lpro8WWBe/Sprint-14_-WTWR) ) and we were told
to replicate it.

The fifth stage (Sprint 14) involves modifying se_project_react (the front end application) by:

1)having the default route display buttons for "Sign Up" & "Log In"

2)creating a pop up window for registering a user when a user clicks on "Sign Up"

3)creating a 2nd pop up window for logging in a user when a user clicks on "Log In"
(a user must already be registered in order to log in)

4)after a user successfully logs in, route the web page to display the add clothes button, username, & username logo

5)implementing registration & authorization logic

6)for the profile view, implement buttons for "Change profile data" & "Log out"

7)implementing edit profile logic

8)implementing like button for each card

9)implementing like & dislike functionality for each card

10)implementing "sign out" (or "log out") functionality
