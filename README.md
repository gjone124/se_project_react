**Intro**

This application is designed to retrieve the current weather at a designated location from an API (openweathermap.org). Based on the current temperature, clothing is recommended to wear.

This is the 6th project for the Triple Ten Software Engineering program. It's associated with Sprint 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

Sprint 10 and 11 focuses on building the front end application (se_project_react).

Sprint 12 and 13 focuses on building the back end application (se_project_express).

Sprint 14 and 15 connects the front end and back end applications to each other.

**Stage 1 (Sprint 10)**

Terminal Scripts Needed To Run Stage 1 Program:

1)npm run dev

For the 1st stage of the project in Sprint 10 (Introduction to React.js), we were given an adaptive web design through figma.com ( [link to Stage 1 Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/F03bTb81Pw8IDPj5Y9rc5i/Sprint-10-%7C-WTWR) ) and we were told to replicate the web page from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JSX.

The first stage involves:

1)calling weather information from the OpenWeather API

2)displaying the weather information on the webpage

3)displaying a default set of clothes depending on if the weather is:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)hot (over 86&deg;F)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)warm (between 66 and 86&deg;F) or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)cold (below 66&deg;F)

4)creating a pop-up window for each piece of clothing that allows the image to expand (and which also displays what type of weather the clothing is suitable for) when the user clicks on the piece of clothing

5)creating a pop-up window with a submission form when the user clicks on the "Add clothes" button

6)creating a dynamic weather card from 14 possible weather conditions that displays an image that represents the current weather (optional)

7)creating a mobile version of the webpage so the words and images are not as smooshed together (optional)

**Stage 2 (Sprint 11)**

Terminal Scripts Needed To Run Stage 2 Program:

1)npm run dev (in 1st terminal)

2)json-server --watch db.json --id \_id --port 3001 (in 2nd terminal)

For the 2nd stage of the project in Sprint 11 (React Routing and State Management), we were given a 2nd design (which added onto the previous design) through figma.com ( [link to Stage 2 Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/dQLJwEKasIdspciJAJrCaf/Sprint-11_-WTWR) ) and we were told to replicate it.

The second stage involves:

1)adding functionality to add & remove pieces of clothing from the collection displayed

2)creating a Toggle Switch to be able to change the temperature displayed from Fahrenheit to Celsius and from Celsius to Fahrenheit

3)creating a mock server using JSON on your local server (http://localhost:3001)

4)creating a Profile component that displays all the potential clothing options

5)creating 2 routes:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)1 for the Main component ("/"; accessed by clicking in the top left corner on the "WTWR" logo)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)1 for the Profile component ("/Profile"; accessed by clicking in the tope right corner on the username (Terrence Tegegne) or the user logo)

6)creating a mobile version of the Profile component (optional)

7)modifying cards to take up full screen width & modifying card rows to shrink / grow smoothly (optional)
